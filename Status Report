### The speed maze

#### So far have installed Pygame because it is easier for more game development to use this platform. I also have coded defined the 
maze generation algorithm by storing it in a 2D list. Then I just use the function defined by the algorithm made to display the maze on the screen. I have begun the 
process of adding in characters and fun elements although I have not created effective code yet.


### I am a little behind but I have a plan for getting my work done. I still need to add the players and the obastacles because I want to have some going throughout the 
maze. 

### I have had issues with fixing my code because it is harder picking out my smaller errors in larger code.
