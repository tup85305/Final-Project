# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

##The ideas I have come up with for the final project are to either create a simple game(like connect four) to explore more game development or use python to develop some sort of blog and explore web development.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## At the moment none

## Do you have any questions of your own?

## Are either topics okay for my final project
